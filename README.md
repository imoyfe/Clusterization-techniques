## Clusterization Techniques

Database: *Digits*, from Sklearn
#### Please, check the PDF presentation to have an extended version of the roadmap of the project.

0. Trying to find out the best numebr of clusters with both *Silhouette* and *Elbow* methods:

1. Dimensionality Reduction | PCA VS LDA

2. Clustering Techniques

Here there are 2D and 3D visualizations for **Kmeans** model:
